Brief description: iOS app for efficient clinical communication mainly between doctors and nurses. Includes intelligent reminder system; clinical directions via voice-input; Firebase integrated data storage and retrieval backend. Frontend interface is intuitive and has sign-up &amp; log-in features. Podfile is not uploaded because the size is too large. You can download it w/ CocoaPod and Ruby.
